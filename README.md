    Hello this is flutter project that wants to be utilaized as a mobile application and web application. This apps goal is to make taking scouting reports for paintball matches much easier. We want to have teams to be able to scout matches and add reports of how the matches are being played so that this data can be easily viewed and useful for the time you are playing your opponent. 

## Getting Started
    As of now we are still needing to work on this application with making it viewable but having a generic use and moderate use. Functions that are still needed would be to have a backend for multiple users to edit and save the reports to be shared across the team. As of now everything is saved locally.
    Still need to setup accounts and find ways to link them together with your team for that tournament.
    Have more accessibality for users to create more events and add the layout and there own bunker names for easier understanding and use with them.
